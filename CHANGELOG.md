# Change Log

## [v1.6.0] - 2025-08-30
- PR[#11](https://github.com/mcu-debug/peripheral-viewer/issues/11): An alternative way to load peripherals information (see [extending-peripheral-viewer.md](https://github.com/mcu-debug/peripheral-viewer/blob/main/docs/extending-peripheral-viewer.md))

## [v1.4.0] - 2023-02-17

- First release from a new repo and new extension inherited from https://github.com/cortex-debug/svd-viewer which in turn derived from https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug. Yes, version number was bumped so Rob can still make any updates to his extension during the transition period
- Note that we are still in `Preview` mode
- Big thanks to [Rob Moran](https://github.com/cortex-debug/svd-viewer/commits?author=thegecko). He did many things to help the community (especially me)
  - Made the SVD viewer browser friendly, and taught me how to do it
  - Refactored a lot of the code from Cortex-Debug and modified it to be browser friendly
  - Added support for CMSIS packs
- Several changes, improvements and fixes have been made
  - We now cache SVD info for faster restarts
  - Several fixes that were pending on the Cortex-Debug repo
- Note that cortex-debug itself will soon no longer do its own SVD/Peripheral support. We hope you use this extension (or others)
- It is still compatible with Desktop and Browser usage
